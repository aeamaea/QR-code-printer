# QR-code-printer
Raspberry Pi based QR code printer, based on Tornado and the Brother QL line of thermal sticker printers. The first version of this codebase was based on some scrappy php and bash.

## Installation
Copy the files from `www` into the root of your web server, and copy `scripts` into the root of your Pi. Make sure to set the permissions correctly, as that is what usually breaks.

## Usage
Go to the `/web` page from your computer or phone, or set up the `/kiosk` page to autostart in fullscreen kiosk mode on your Pi.
